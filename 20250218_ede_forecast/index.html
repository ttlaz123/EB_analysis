        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>
            Fisher matrices are used to forecast the uncertainties in 
            cosmological parameters when experimental conditions, such as sky coverage or observation time, 
            are improved. Below, we present the Fisher matrices used to project uncertainties for the parameters 
            \( g, \alpha_{150}, \alpha_{220}, \alpha_{K95}, \) and \( \alpha_{B95lf} \)  (previously refered to as B95e). These matrices encode the 
            expected uncertainties and correlations between parameters under the assumption of Gaussian likelihoods.

        <h2>Fisher Matrix Calculations</h2>
        
            <h3>Mathematical Derivation of the Fisher Matrix</h3>
            The Fisher forecasting methodology and calculations presented here are adapted from 
    <a href="https://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/~bicep2/papers/thesi/Keck/VB_PhD_Thesis_Final.pdf">Victor Buza's thesis</a>, which provides a detailed derivation and validation of the framework 
    using Bicep/Keck data (see Section 7 of the thesis for the full mathematical treatment).
       
            <p>
                The Fisher matrix \( F_{ij} \) quantifies the information content of the data about the parameters \( \theta_i \). For a likelihood function \( \mathcal{L}(\theta; d) \), it is defined as:
                \[
                F_{ij} = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ln \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}\right],
                \]
                where \( \mathbb{E}[\cdot] \) denotes the expectation value over the data.
            </p>
        
         
            <p>
                For Gaussian-distributed data with mean \( \mu(\theta) \) and covariance \( \Sigma(\theta) \), the log-likelihood is:
                \[
                \ln \mathcal{L}(\theta; d) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( d - \mu(\theta) \right)^T \Sigma(\theta)^{-1} \left( d - \mu(\theta) \right) - \frac{1}{2} \ln \det \Sigma(\theta).
                \]
                The Fisher matrix becomes:
                \[
                F_{ij} = \frac{\partial \mu^T}{\partial \theta_i} \Sigma^{-1} \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \theta_j} + \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}\left( \Sigma^{-1} \frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial \theta_i} \Sigma^{-1} \frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial \theta_j} \right).
                \]
                In our case, the \(\theta\)s are the photon-axion coupling constant \(g\) and the polarization rotation angles \(\alpha_\nu\) where each \(\nu\) represents the different receiver frequencies.
                For our fiducial model, we assume \(\mu(\theta)\) is zero for both \(g\) and each of the polarization rotation angles. A quick check verifies that using different values for 
                our parameters in our fiducial model has negligible effect on the Fisher forecast as long as the values are small.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Assuming a fixed covariance matrix (\( \Sigma(\theta) = \Sigma \)), the second term vanishes:
                \[
                F_{ij} = \frac{\partial \mu^T}{\partial \theta_i} \Sigma^{-1} \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \theta_j}.
                \]
            </p>
        
     
            <p>
                The Cramér-Rao bound gives the minimum variance for parameter \( \theta_i \):
                \[
                \sigma_{ii} = \sqrt{(F^{-1})_{ii}}.
                \]
            </p>

            The simulation uncertainties are slightly larger than the uncertainties from the Fisher Forecast because it calculates
             the minimum bound, which is not necessarily true for any particular realization.

    <h2>Forecast for Future Observations</h2>
    <h3>Scaling BK18 Signal and Noise</h3>
    <p>
        After verifying that the Fisher Forecast parameter uncertainties are consistent with our simulation results 
        in the previous update, we extended the analysis by varying sky fraction, noise level, and observation time. 
        At this stage, we assume uniform scaling and do not yet account for the impact of individual or new receivers 
        on the uncertainties. <strong>Uniform scaling</strong> means that noise and sky fraction scaling factors 
        are applied equally across all frequency bands and receivers.
    </p>
    
    <p>To scale the covariance matrix, we decompose it into six components:</p>
    
    \[
        \text{Cov} = \sigma + \text{sn}_1 + \text{sn}_2 + \text{sn}_3 + \text{sn}_4 + \text{noi}
    \]
    
    <p>where</p>
    
    \[
    \sig = (S \times S, S \times S)
    \]
    
    \[
    \text{sn}_1 = (S \times N, S \times N)
    \]
    
    \[
    \text{sn}_2 = (S \times N, N \times S)
    \]
    
    \[
    \text{sn}_3 = (N \times S, S \times N)
    \]
    
    \[
    \text{sn}_4 = (N \times S, N \times S)
    \]
    
    \[
    \text{noi} = (N \times N, N \times N)
    \]
    
    <p>
        The signal components (\(S\)) scale with sky fraction, while the noise components (\(N\)) scale with noise. 
        Our base assumption is that each \(S\) scales with the square root of the sky fraction ratio. 
        For example, doubling the sky fraction would scale \(sig\) by:
    </p>
    
    \[
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}} = \frac{1}{4}
    \]
    
    <p>
        since there are four \(S\)'s in \(\sigma\). This reflects how increasing sky coverage reduces signal variance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Similarly, we assume that noise decreases with increased observation time. However, if observation time remains 
        constant while sky fraction increases, noise increases because less time is spent on each part of the sky. 
        To account for this, we present two different cases:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A scenario where noise remains independent of sky fraction.</li>
        <li>A scenario where observation time remains independent, allowing noise to increase with sky fraction.</li>
    </ul>

        <figcaption>
            
            <p>The pager shows how g uncertainties scale with experimental improvements for different forecast scenarios. The units are
                all in ratio with respect to the current value. For example, total observed time of 2 indicates the case where
                the data is obtained from twice as much time spent observing as the current available data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sky Fraction Scaling Only</strong>: Looks at the impact of increased sky coverage and assumes noise level stays the same. Only signal covariance is scaled.</li>
                <li><strong>Sky Fraction + Noise</strong>: Assumes noise levels are independent of sky coverage. Both independently scaled.</li>
                <strong>Sky Fraction + Observation Time</strong>: Combines sky coverage and observation time scaling 
                                            (assumes noise scales linearly with sky coverage and inversely with observation time).</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Only</strong>: Assumes current sky coverage.</li>
            </ul>

            We include two different datasets for comparison.

    <p>As expected, we observe that as observation time increases, noise level decreases, and sky fraction increases, 
        the uncertainty on \( g \) decreases. The magenta line in the <strong>sky fraction + noise</strong> plot represents 
        the same scenario as the magenta line in the <strong>sky fraction + observation time</strong> plot, which, in turn, 
        corresponds to the scenario in the <strong>sky fraction scaling only</strong> plot. This consistency arises because, 
        as sky fraction increases with a constant observation time, the observation time per unit area of the sky decreases, 
        leading to an overall increase in noise. This effect is evident in the <strong>sky fraction + observation time</strong> 
        plot: while a larger sky fraction provides more data points and initially reduces the uncertainty on \( g \), 
        the accompanying rise in noise eventually outweighs the benefits of the increased sky coverage.</p>

        <p>These findings suggest two potential strategies to achieve the literature value of \( \Delta g = \pm 0.15 \):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain the current sky fraction</strong> but increase the observation time by a factor of 10.</li>
            <li><strong>Expand the observed sky area by a factor of 3</strong> while maintaining the same noise level, 
                which would require a corresponding threefold increase in observation time.</li>
        </ul>
        Unfortunately, both of these strategies require significant resources that are not realistically available.
        <h3>Scaling B3 with Planck</h3>
        <p>
        We include another scenario where we only consider the B3 + Planck dataset: using only 
        B95lf and the 5 Planck frequencies of 
        P30, P44, P143, P217, and P353. This is the Planck data restricted to
        the BICEP large field, but if we hypothetically increase the skyfraction observed by B3, we 
        can use existing Planck data to also scale the skyfraction of the Planck maps in the analysis.
        Accordingly, the noise level of the Planck maps would not change.
        </p>
        <p>In this case, instead of applying uniform scaling to noise and sky fraction across all receivers, we scale only the noise 
            component of the B3 receiver. This is done by identifying the specific indices in the covariance matrix corresponding to 
            the B3 frequency cross- and auto-spectra, then applying the appropriate noise and signal scaling factors.

            <p>The pager is similar to Figure 4.1 using different datasets. However, here we scale the skyfraction 
                for both B3 and Planck maps, but only scale the noise level of B3.

    <p>We see that by including the Planck data into the analysis, we are able to constrain the uncertainty more than 
        if we only used B95lf. However, even though the amount is non-negligible, we still require significant 
        resources to reach literature levels.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>We see that significant resources are required to constrain the photon-axion coupling constant \(g\) to literature levels.
        With new data from the BA receivers, it may be possible to constrain \(g\) with data we already expect to receive, but 
        as the limiting factor appears to be sky coverage, it is unlikely that new data will contribute significantly.
        
        We are currently examining the impact of a finer binning of BICEP data. With a hypothetical larger sky fraction, 
        we may be able to use finer bins to better constrain the EB curve.
