        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In Eskilt et al. 2023 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15369" target="_blank">
                Constraint on Early Dark Energy from Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence</a>), 
            the authors investigate the presence of Early Dark Energy (EDE) 
            by analyzing its potential impact on the polarization of the CMB. They explore the 
            possibility that the EDE field, \( \phi \), is a pseudoscalar "axionlike" field that interacts 
            with electromagnetism in a parity-violating manner. The Lagrangian density for such a field is given by:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 - V(\phi) - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - 
            \frac{1}{4} g \phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            where \( g \) represents the photon-axion coupling constant. The term involving \( g \phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu} \) is a Chern-Simons term that breaks parity symmetry.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The authors use a "canonical" EDE potential:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \cos(\phi/f)]^3
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This model has been proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. Additional constraints and 
            alternative EDE models are discussed in the references listed in the paper.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            They constrain the coupling constant \( g \) for pre-recombination Early Dark Energy (EDE), while accounting for post-recombination cosmic birefringence and miscalibration angles, \( \alpha + \beta \). To achieve this, the authors fit the stacked EB power spectrum for both \( g \) and \( \alpha + \beta \) simultaneously.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The analysis uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, <em>emcee</em>, to sample these parameters. The log-likelihood function is given by:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            -2 \ln L = \sum_b \frac{v_b^2}{\text{Var}(C_{EB,o}^b)}
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            where \( v_b \) is defined as:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            v_b \equiv {C}^{EB,o}_b -  \, 
            g M_{\text{Pl}} C^{EB,\text{EDE}}_b \cos[4(\alpha + \beta)] - 
            \frac{1}{2} \left(C^{EE,\text{CMB}}_b - C^{BB,\text{CMB}}_b\right)  \sin[4(\alpha + \beta)]
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The CMB EE and BB power spectra are computed using CAMB with the best-fitting
            \(\Lambda\text{CDM}\) parameters from the Planck 2018 analysis. The EDE EB power 
            spectrum is calculated using a modified version of the CLASS code, with 
            \( g = M_{\text{Pl}}^{-1} \) as the coupling constant and 
            other parameters, \(f_{EDE}\), \(z_c\), and \(\theta_i\) obtained from best fit 
            parameters of Planck and BOSS data. The reduced Planck mass is 
            approximately \( 2.4 \times 10^{18} \) GeV.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Using Planck's and SH0ES's polarization data, they investigated cosmic birefringence and its relation 
            to EDE, calculating power spectra and sampling parameters with MCMC methods. Their goal was to differentiate
            between standard \(\Lambda\text{CDM}\) and EDE models. The study found  
            \( g = (0.04 \pm 0.16) \, \text{M}^{-1}_{\text{Pl}} \) (68% CL).
        </p>
    
        <p>
            We reproduce their findings and apply a similar methodology to analyze 
            BICEP/Keck 18 (BK18) data, focusing on the EB spectra. Aligning with Eskilt’s approach, 
            we account for post-recombination birefringence and polarization calibration angles, 
            comparing BICEP data with their results. We utilize the
            <a href="https://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bkcmb/analysis_logbook/analysis/20201221_BK18_polrot/" 
            target="_blank">BK18 polarization rotation analysis (2020)</a> performed by Kenny with 
            Cobaya MCMC to verify consistency, finding results aligned with Eskilt’s 
            constraints on \( g \) and Kenny's polarization rotation angles.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Additionally, we extend the analysis by performing MCMC calculations on 
            individual frequencies and conducting a multicomponent analysis combining several 
            frequencies. We examine different bin ranges, using both 
            2-10 and 2-17 bin configurations to evaluate improvements in constraint precision.

        <h2>Reproducing BK18 Polarization Rotation</h2>
    
        <p>
            This section reproduces Kenny's findings on BK18 polarization rotation using the Cobaya MCMC framework. 
            The goal is to verify consistency with Kenny's results across various configurations and including different frequencies, 
            binning schemes. The original analysis can be found in 
            <a href="https://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bkcmb/analysis_logbook/analysis/20201221_BK18_polrot/" target="_blank">
                Kenny's Polarization Rotation Analysis (2020)
            </a>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The CMB signal can be modified by applying a uniform rotation. The modified spectrum is given by:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            C^{EB}_{\ell, \text{expected}} = \frac{1}{2} (C^{EE}_{\ell} - C^{BB}_{\ell}) \sin(4(\alpha + \beta))
            \end{equation}
        </p>
        The polarization rotation analysis is equivalent to the expected \(C^{EB}_{\ell, \text{expected}}\) term in Eskilt's analysis
        when the \(C^{EB,\text{EDE}}_b\) term is set to zero:
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            C^{EB}_{b, \text{expected}} = \frac{1}{2} (C^{EE}_{b} - 
            C^{BB}_{b}) \sin(4(\alpha + \beta))
            + g M_{\text{Pl}} C^{EB,\text{EDE}}_b \cos[4(\alpha + \beta)]
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \(C^{EE}_{\ell}\) and \(C^{BB}_{\ell}\) are obtained from the summation of model_lens and model_dust 
            with paths as stated in the appendix. To assess the fit of the modified spectra to observed data, we calculate the difference 
            between the model expectation values \( C^{EB}_{b, \text{expected}} \) and the real bandpowers \( C^{EB}_{b, \text{observed}} \), 
            where \( b \) denotes binned bandpowers over a range in \( \ell \). The \(\chi^2\) value is computed using the bandpower covariance 
            matrix \( \text{C}_{EB} \):
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            \chi^2 = ( C^{EB}_{b, \text{observed}} - C^{EB}_{b, \text{expected}} )^\top 
            ( \text{C}_{EB} )^{-1} ( C^{EB}_{b, \text{observed}} - C^{EB}_{b, \text{expected}} )
            \end{equation}
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This analysis is similar to Eskilt's MCMC analysis where \( C^{EB, \text{EDE}}_b \) is set to zero, with a few differences:
            Eskilt zeros out all nondiagonal terms of the covariance matrix, while Kenny retains up to the second off-diagonal term. 
            Eskilt uses MCMC for the analysis, whereas Kenny employs matmin to minimize the \(\chi^2\). Additionally, Eskilt uses around 
            70 bins up to \( \ell = 1500 \), whereas the BICEP spectra analysis uses less than 20 bins up to \( \ell = 500 \).

            With the EDE set to zero, the results are within a hundredth of a degree of Kenny's results. 
            Including extra bins does not change the results beyond a few hundredths of a degree, 
            which is within the margin of error, suggesting a robust measurement. 
            With EDE set to zero, the triangle plots show \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) roughly uniform, 
            with the angle \( \alpha + \beta \) (aplusb) centered around the same polarization 
            rotation calculated by Kenny. The \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) term should be uniform 
            because it has no effect on the likelihood when the EDE curve is set to zero.

            We use an EDE spectrum with \(f_{EDE}=0.07\) for our preliminary analysis
            provided directly by the authors of the paper; note that this is not 
            the spectrum used by the actual paper.  
            Examining the triangle plots when including the EDE spectrum in the analysis,
            we see that when we only use bins 2-10, the \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) term and 
            \( \alpha + \beta \) term 
            exhibit a negative correlation with a very wide spread.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To understand this feature, we examine \( v_b \) from equation (4). Because BB is much smaller 
            than EE, its contribution to the parameters is negligible. Our angle \( \alpha + \beta \) is quite small, 
            so if we also apply the small angle approximation, the \( v_b \) from equation (4) becomes:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[
            \begin{equation}
            v_b \approx {C}^{EB,o}_b - 
            g M_{\text{Pl}} C^{EB,\text{EDE}}_b - 
            \frac{(\alpha + \beta)}{2} \left(C^{EE,\text{CMB}}_b\right)
            \end{equation}
            \]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The component spectra plots show that the EDE curve and the EE curve are quite proportional 
            up to \( \ell \) of 300. Approximating this observation, our \( v_b \) from equation (4) becomes:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[
            \begin{equation}
            v_b \approx {C}^{EB,o}_b - 
            \left(g M_{\text{Pl}} \times \text{scale} - \frac{(\alpha + \beta)}{2}\right) C^{EE,\text{CMB}}_b
            \end{equation}
            \]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Where \(\text{scale}\) is some arbitrary scale factor that would be baked into \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \). 
            This gives a degeneracy between \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) and \( \alpha + \beta \), causing the observed correlation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, once higher \( \ell \) bins are included, we see that the EDE curve begins to diverge 
            more significantly from the EE curve. This causes the spread for \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) to decrease and center 
            around 0. This suggests that the EDE contributions do not fit the data better than a simple polarization rotation.

        <h2>Adding Early Dark Energy EB Spectrum and Simplified Multicomponent Analysis</h2>
    
        <p>
            We perform a simplified version of the multicomponent analysis on the 5 measured EB spectra 
            from the 5 different frequency bands. 
            We fit six parameters: the photon-axion coupling constant \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) and five 
            different angles \( \text{aplusb}_{\text{freq}} \), one for each frequency band. 
            Instead of including all the cross-spectra and covariances between the 5 different frequency 
            bands, we sum the likelihood functions to quickly produce initial results.
            We further differ from Eskilt's analysis by using up to two off-diagonal terms in the covariance 
            matrix when calculating the likelihood. We also use the lensing + dust model provided by 
            the input files with the linked paths noted in the appendix rather than from CAMB. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            When the EDE spectrum is set to zero, the results align with those from single 
            component analyses with the EDE spectrum set to zero as there is no coupling term 
            between the different angles beyond the \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) term.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            We perform the analysis on the first three simulation realizations to visualize what the 
            real data may look like when there is no rotation or EDE. 
            When the EDE spectrum is included, the triangle plots show \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) 
            a spread that is consistent with \( gM_{\text{Pl}} = 0 \).
             Again, when using fewer bins, the large spread is due to the degeneracy
              between the EDE and EE spectra at those 
             \( \ell \) bins. As additional bins are added, \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) centers around
              0 with a smaller spread. We see a sigma of about 0.25 for each simulation, 
              which is slightly larger than Eskilt's 0.16.

            We perform the same MCMC analysis on the 499 simulations using the simplified multicomponent 
            approach. Again, using only bins 2-10 results in a greater spread for every variable
             due to the similarity between the EDE EB curve and the EE curve, which can cancel 
             each other out with a negative correlation.
        </p>
    
       
        <p>
            In the triangle plots, we plot the peaks of all simulations in red, 
            and we observe that the parameters
             are centered around 0 for both \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) and each polarization rotation angle. 
             This aligns with simulations that do not include Early Dark Energy or polarization rotations.
            In blue, we plot the spread of a single simulation, whose peaks land within the red contour plot. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            For both bins 2-10 and 2-17, we expect the measured EB spectra to
            differ from the simulations in the polarization rotation, 
            because the real data are measured by detectors that likely 
            have some inherent polarization rotation.
            If the \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) 
            results align with the simulations that exclude Early Dark Energy, we further constrain 
            the parameter \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \), supporting Eskilt's result that it is consistent with zero.
            On the other hand, if the \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) results fall to the left or right of the 
            simulated peaks in red, that would suggest the addition of an EDE curve better matches our 
            observations, and we can provide an initial estimate of the parameter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We list the chisq below for the three simulations when EDE curve is included . 
            They are roughly equal to the sum of the chisq of each frequency in the single 
            component analysis. The chisq are roughly the same whether EDE is zeroed out 
            or not, suggesting that adding the curve does not produce a better fit. This is 
            consistent with the simulations, as they do not simulate Early Dark Energy.

                    Because the ratio between the peak spread and the 
                    posterior likelihood spread is about the same as the reduced chi-squared value, 
                    this discrepancy might indicate a problem with the covariance 
                    calculations. The reduced-chi squared hovers around 2 instead of 1,
                    suggesting an underestimate of the error variance. This may be 
                    caused by a nongaussian distribution of the bandpowers, especially 
                    at lower \(\ell\).

                <strong>Perform Full Multicomponent Analysis:</strong>
                <p>
                    A full multicomponent analysis involves analyzing all available cross-spectra 
                    to capture the complete picture of the polarization data. 
                    By including all the cross-spectra in the analysis and 
                    calculating the full covariance matrix, we can better 
                    account for the interactions 
                    between different frequencies.

                <strong>Perform the fit across different EDE curves:</strong>
                <p>
                    The Early Dark Energy EB curve depends on three parameters:
                    the maximum energy density fraction \(f_{EDE}\) reached at a redshift
                   \(z_c\), and the dimensionless initial value of the EDE field \(\theta_i\). 
                   Eskilt's analysis takes the best fitting parameters from Planck and BOSS data, 
                   then fixes them in the MCMC analysis. To account for the potential impact of 
                   the parameters \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \) and rotation angle, Eskilt repeats the analysis 
                   for different values of \(f_{EDE}\) and shows that the 
                   change in chi squared varies less than 0.1. Instead of taking fixed values,
                   we may consider marginalizing these three 
                   parameters when fitting for \( gM_{\text{Pl}} \).
